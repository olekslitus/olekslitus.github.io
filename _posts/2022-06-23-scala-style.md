# My Scala Style

Please be welcome to make a PR and modify the style guide.
I want this to become a style guided created by the community.
This style guide is orriented on functional programming and new Scala developers.
We are not going against the Official Style Guide, only extend it.
It was initially based on libraries such as ZIO and Cats Effect.
